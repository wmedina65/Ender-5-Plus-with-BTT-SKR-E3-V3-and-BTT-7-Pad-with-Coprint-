# Ender-5-Plus-with-BTT-SKR-Mini E3-V3-and-BTT-7-Pad-with-Coprint-
This is a journey still in the making. Will be updated as I work thru the setup.
In the files Chroma_head.cfg, Kcm.cfg, and Printer.cfg [MCU or MCU something] replace them with your Id's.
I am still working on this build project but, I will update as i get it better than it is. These files work but not perfectly.
at this time. but a real good head start.
